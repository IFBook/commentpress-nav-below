Description: <strong>A demo child theme for CommentPress Core with navigation below branding.</strong> <em>Important note for Multisite:</em> if you want to use this theme <em>without network-activating CommentPress Core</em> then you will need to network-activate this theme despite it appearing in the "Broken" themes section of your Network Admin. To do so, you need to use the "Bulk Actions" dropdown. It will then appear as an available theme only on blogs that have CommentPress Core enabled. If you <em>have network-enabled CommentPress Core</em>, then this theme will appear as normal.
