The following styles show what can be done with a child theme to change the look
of a CommentPress site. The Theme Customizer in Wordpress 3.4 allows quite a lot
of changes to be made, but child themes allow much more to be done.

Some of the styles below refer to CommentPress in a Multisite BuddyPress context
and may not be relevant to your situation. Chop and change as you see fit.

When you're happy, use a minifier such as <http://www.refresh-sf.com/yui/> to
compress your CSS and paste it into `style-overrides.css`.

BUT...

Before you start editing and wondering why you're not seeing any changes to your
site, you will have to make a small adjustment to your `wp-config.php` file so
that Wordpress chooses this file instead of the minified one. Add this line:

define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true);

somewhere in your `wp-config.php` file. Remove it when you've updated your 
minified file and want Wordpress to select that one instead.
